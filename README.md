## ⌚️ watchOS Migration Starter (Glanceable Edition)

This repo now includes a minimal watchOS-only starter view under `MoodTunesWatch/` that demonstrates a **single-purpose, glanceable flow**. The watch target is expected to:

- Collapse multi-screen flows into one quick action screen.
- Prefer a **single mood selection** + **one action** (e.g., play suggestion).
- Defer heavier network work to iPhone when possible.
- Avoid frequent timers and background updates.

**Files added for watchOS scaffolding:**

- `MoodTunesWatch/MoodTunesWatchApp.swift` (watchOS-only App entry)
- `MoodTunesWatch/WatchHomeView.swift` (glanceable mood + play action)

> Note: You still need to add a watchOS target in Xcode and assign these files to that target.
